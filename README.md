# Massive machine learning experiments using mlr and OpenML

In this study, we investigate and summarize the performance of a wide range of ML algorithms (using its default hyper-parameter values) on a wide range of OpenML classifications tasks. This will yield a meta-dataset that can be leveraged for algorithm selection and many future studies into learning performance.
